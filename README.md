# knockwho
A basic implementation of a port knocking tool using the Rust programming.

About portknocking:
  Port knocking is a security technique in which a series of connection attempts to closed ports are used as a password to open a specific port. A port knocking tool using the Rust programming language would use Rust's low-level control over network communications to listen for a series of connection attempts to closed ports, and then open a specific port if the connection attempts match a pre-defined password. This tool could be used to enhance the security of a network by providing an additional layer of authentication for access to specific services.

To generate a port knocking tool using the Rust programming language, you would need to take the following steps:

>Install the Rust programming language and any necessary dependencies.

>Create a new Rust project and add the necessary dependencies for networking and port knocking functionality.

>Define the closed ports that will be used for the port knocking sequence and the specific port that will be opened if the sequence is successful.

>Implement a function to listen for incoming connection attempts on the closed ports and store the IP addresses and timestamps of the attempts in a buffer.

>Implement a function to compare the sequence of connection attempts in the buffer with the pre-defined password, and open the specific port if the sequence matches.

>Test the port knocking tool to ensure that it functions as expected.

Once the port knocking tool has been generated and tested, it can be used to enhance the security of a network by providing an additional layer of authentication for access to specific services.
