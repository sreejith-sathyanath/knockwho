# knockwho
A basic implementation of a port knocking tool using the Rust programming.
Port knocking is a security technique in which a series of connection attempts to closed ports are used as a password to open a specific port. A port knocking tool using the Rust programming language would use Rust's low-level control over network communications to listen for a series of connection attempts to closed ports, and then open a specific port if the connection attempts match a pre-defined password. This tool could be used to enhance the security of a network by providing an additional layer of authentication for access to specific services.
